                    Hi! I am <strong><u>Federico LÃ³pez</u></strong

                </p>
                <br />
                <p>
                    I'm a Software Engineer with more than ten years of work in
                    technology. Currently working as a FrontEnd Web Developer.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I'm a passionate individual who always wants to learn more about
                    software engineering and computer science. I consider myself a quick
                    learner always setting out challenges to learn different programming
                    concepts and to find a more efficient way of solving problems.
